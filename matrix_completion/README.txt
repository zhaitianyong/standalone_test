This package includes four different algorithms for matrix completion problems: NIHT_Matrix, CGIHT_Matrix, ASD, and ScaledASD. 
Please cite corresponding papers when you use it.

Installation: 
   Run startup.m to set up MATLAB path.
   Run compile_mex.m if necessary, although the mex files have already been compiled for Linux and Mac system. 
   Run demo.m to see the examples.

Content: 
   Main/: This folder contains the interface codes to different algorithms.
   Auxiliary/: This folder contains two mex files (to take advantage the sparse structure of matrix completion, written by Wen, Yin and Zhang for LMaFit)
               and two matlab files (to provide the stopping conditions and initial points for different algorithms, adaptions from LRGeomCG by Vandereycken).

Usage: there are two sorts of tests that can be conducted
  1. matrix_completion('alg_name', m, n, p, r, epsilon) e.g., matrix_completion('CGIHT_Matrix', 1000, 1000, 100000, 20, 0) or matrix_completion('CGIHT_Matrix', 1000, 1000, 100000, 20):
     it will run CGIHT_Matrix for a random problem with m = 1000, n = 1000 (matrix size), p = 100000 (number of sampled entries), r = 20 (matrix rank) 
     and epsilon = 0 (noise free), and write the output into a file. The alg_name are those algorithm names in Main file.

  2. random_inpaint('alg_name', 'img'): it will reconstruct an image ('Boat', 'Barbara' and 'Lena') from 35% of random sampled entries, e.g., random_inpaint('CGIHT_Matrix', 'boat.png')
     cross_inpaint('alg_name', 'img'): it will reconstruct an image ('Boat', 'Barbara' and 'Lena') from an image masked by a cross, e.g., cross_inpaint('CGIHT_Matrix', 'boat.png')
